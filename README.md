# 🏡 AirBnB Clone Project

Welcome to the AirBnB Clone Project — a full-stack web application inspired by the core features of the AirBnB platform. This project is part of my journey to mastering both frontend and backend engineering and building scalable, user-centric digital products.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Recreate the core functionality of AirBnB (user authentication, property listings, booking system)
- Practice full-stack development using modern tools and best practices
- Build a responsive, interactive UI with dynamic data handling
- Deploy a working MVP and iterate with advanced features (search filters, reviews, payments)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- React.js (for dynamic UI components)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)

**Backend:**
- Python with Django or Node.js with Express
- RESTful API design
- MongoDB or SQL (for data storage)

**DevOps & Tools:**
- Git & GitHub (version control)
- Postman (API testing)
- Docker (for containerization)
- Render or Heroku (for deployment)
